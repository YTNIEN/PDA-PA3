# 2017PDA PA3 - Fixed Outline Floorplanning

In this PA, students are asked to write a fixed-outline floorplanner which can handle hard macros.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+

## Build

* No compilation needed.

## Usage

```
./PA3.py <alpha> <input_block> <input_net> <output>
```
Note:
1. Make PA3.py executable, e.g. `chmod u+x PA3.py`, first.
2. Input files <input_block> and <input_net> are block file and net file respectively.
3. The used Python interpreter is uhome/chome/2017PDA/2017PDA01/anaconda3/bin/python. Since this interpreter has been set in PA3.py via shebang line, there is no need to invoke it explicitly.
